## My process

I start with HTML and try to think how it should look. Then I start styling in CSS, putting color variables and typograhy first. I always use a mobile first approach as it is easier to make it that way. I then work on layouts which ends up taking the longest. Little tweaks til it looks right and BAM its done. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I leaned a lot with this one. I got reintroduced to tables and ordered lists. The ::marker property was a new one for me and it is really cool because it allows for more style options. I liked the bottom border for styling and it was fun to implement. 

### Continued development

I think I will continue to work on using elements like bottom borders and ::marker to style lists. I also want to continue to work on my CSS skills and make sure I am using the best practices. I would like to make these elements that I could just drop into a project randomly but I have to learn how to use more generic html classes that I can style.
